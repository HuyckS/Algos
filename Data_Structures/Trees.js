// Trees - consists of nodes that connected with parent/child relationship
// -- has branches of nodes that connect to many other nodes
// -- each node can have zero to many references to other nodes
// -- node can only reference a child (not a sibling or group of nodes with the same parent)
// -- has one root (top node of the tree)
// -- leaf - a node with no children

// Binary Trees -- at most have 2 children per node

// Binary Search Trees -- same as binary trees, but sorted in a particular order
// everything to the left of the parent node is less than the parent node and everything to the right is greater
